    Hi, I'm a computer science major at [Pomona College](http://pomona.edu) in Greater Los Angeles. I am the founder and maintainer of the [5C Ride Share App](http://5crideshare.com) and am currently working on LikeSecretâ€”a startup dedicated to solving the dating problems that plague many college students.

    At Pomona, I play on the [varsity soccer team](http://www.pe.pomona.edu/sports/msoc/index), am an active member of the [Kairos Society](http://kairossociety.org), and am getting involved with our campus AMC chapter. When I'm not in front of a computer, I love playing beach volleyball, telemark skiing, discussing politics, entrepreneurship, and technology, and riding my [Sole fixed gear](http://www.solebicycles.com/).
